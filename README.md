# DDoS Detection And Mitigation In SDN

-> OpenFlow

-> Mininet

-> POX Controller

-> RYU Controller

-> Miniedit


## Procedure:

1. Creation of network topology using mininet.

2. Using Controllers like POX and ryu to provide a centralized control plane for managing and controlling network devices.

3. Getting a threshold value for the normal traffic.

4. Performing attack in the network using python script.

5. Getting a value after the attack and based on the output value, detection can be confirmed.

6. Setting OpenFlow rules within the SDN controller, to specify how traffic should be handled and define policies to mitigate DDOS attack.
